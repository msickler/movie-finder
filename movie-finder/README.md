# Movie Finder

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/movie/finder`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Welcome to Movie Finder! Yes, that is exactly what we do. You give us a genre, from our exquisite selection of genres and, good Sir, we will show you the top 100 movies of said genre (at least, according to RottenTomatoes, a very realiable not Fake News source in my humble opinion).
Now, of course you could do that yourself on the blessed RottenTomatoes website, but here we will help you actually pick one movie to watch, as it can get tedious on the very acclaimed website.
We can list you the top 100 per genre by rating or by name and you can search by words or rating. We'll give you everything that matches.
Furthermore, we can provide you with a movie "shuffle" selection, all it takes is to the say the word (the genre) and you've got yourself a title.
Of course, we would be a bit useless if we couldn't also provide you with a movie synonpsis. We do that too.
Enjoy!
